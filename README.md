# COSC4331-Project-Final

This is part of a project me and a partner did for our Real Time Systems course. These files are meant to be used with STR-SUMO (https://github.com/DDeChoU/Selfless-Traffic-Routing-Testbed).
Explanation of the files:

experiment.py - Script that lets users easily simulate and benchmark arbitrary traffic routing algorithms
AstarController.py - An implementation of th A\* routing/search algorithm
STR_SUMO_win.py - Windows compatible version of original STR-SUMO file
target_vehicles_generation_protocols_win.py - Windows compatible version of original STR-SUMO file
